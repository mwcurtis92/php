   <h3>About the Developers</h3>
   <p style = "padding-left:10px;">
      RateMyGroup was primarily created by Frunder Dagoude, a programmer situated in a small, town in the 
      Alps. Frunder's town is devoid of electricity, and the code for this site was mailed page by page to the 
      headquarters in the US. How Frunder managed to create bug-free pages without the use 
      of a computer (which he has never seen), electricity, a modern pen (he used a quill), or the internet, is a 
      mystery. However, it truly does testify to his mystical skill as a developer of PHP.

      Mackenzie Bodily was the poor, starving college student who delivered the pages of code, one at a time, to
      the US RateMyGroup headquarters. Every now and then, she would also bring bagels.

      Scott Burton oversaw the project, ensuring quality and skill in the transcription for Dagoude's pages of 
      code. He also pays for the office space.
