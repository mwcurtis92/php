   <h3>About RateMyGroup</h3>
   <p style = "padding-left:10px;">RateMyGroup is an organization dedicated to the principles of equal work and effort. We believe that 
      all projects large and small involve others in some way! However, we understand that, especially in 
       academic settings, group members are reluctant to assist. So before you sign up with a group for that
       final project, check their rating!</p>
